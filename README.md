# Smart-Agriculture-using-IOT-Technology.-project
Smart agriculture is a farming system which uses IoT technology. This emerging system increases the quantity and quality of agricultural products. IoT devices provide information about nature of farming fields and then take action depending on the farmer input. In this paper, an IoT based advanced solution for monitoring the soil conditions and atmosphere for efficient crop growth is presented. The developed system is capable of monitoring temperature, humidity, soil moisture level using NodeMCU and several sensors connected to it. Also, a notification in the form of SMS will be sent to farmerâ€™s phone using Wi-Fi about environmental condition of the field.
